The hosp module contains data derived from the hospital wide EHR. These measurements are predominantly recorded during the hospital stay, though some tables include data from outside the hospital as well (e.g. outpatient laboratory tests in labevents). Information includes laboratory measurements (labevents, d_labitems), microbiology cultures (microbiologyevents, d_micro), provider orders (poe, poe_detail), medication administration (emar, emar_detail), medication prescription (prescriptions, pharmacy), hospital billing information (diagnoses_icd, d_icd_diagnoses, procedures_icd, d_icd_procedures, hcpcsevents, d_hcpcs, drgcodes), and service related information (services).
